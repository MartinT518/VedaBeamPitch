   # Add remote repository (replace with your GitHub repo)
   git remote add origin https://github.com/vedabeam/vedabeam-platform.git
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Repository Structure**
   - Ensure all files are uploaded correctly

   - Wait for build to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

2. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check deployment logs for any errors
   - Visit the generated Railway URL (e.g., `your-app.railway.app`)
   - Test the waitlist form functionality
   - Verify the health check endpoint: `/health`

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to Variables tab
   - Add any additional environment variables if needed
   - NODE_ENV and PORT are automatically configured

### Phase 4: Custom Domain Configuration (15 minutes)

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. Build Fails**
- Check package.json for correct dependencies
- Verify Node.js version compatibility
- Review Railway build logs for specific errors

**2. Domain Not Working**
- Verify DNS records are correctly configured
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)
- Check Railway domain configuration

**3. Form Not Submitting**
- Check server logs in Railway dashboard
- Verify `/api/waitlist` endpoint is working
- Test with browser developer tools

**4. Images Not Loading**
- Ensure assets are in `/public/assets/` directory
- Check file paths in HTML
- Verify images were uploaded to GitHub

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Test locally before deployment
npm install
npm start

# Check server health
curl https://vedabeam.com/health

# Test waitlist endpoint
curl -X POST https://vedabeam.com/api/waitlist \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","name":"Test User"}'
```
